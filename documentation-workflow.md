# Documentation workflow

One of the major pain points for my team was bottlenecks. We were constantly addressing issues that contained very little information. This drove up the average age of our tickets and subsequently contributed to longer resolution times. 

To demonstrate the problem, I created the following workflow. As a result, we implemented a new template in Jira that requested justification of the request, definition of done, and links to any resources. The additional description fields greatly helped triage tickets and improve our metrics.
