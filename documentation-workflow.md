# Documentation workflow

A major pain point for the documentation team was bottlenecking. Requests to resolve bugs in documentation, major revisions or updates, and requests for new pages lacked information critical to resolving issues. This problem resulted in driving up the average ticket age and subsequently contributed to longer resolution times.

To highlight the problem, I created a workflow.

After detailing the journey of a request, I worked with our product operations team to implement a new template in Jira. Now, when filing a Jira issue, there are fields for justification, definition of done, and links to any internal or external resources. The extra fields have helped triage tickets and improve the overall metrics for the documentation team.
