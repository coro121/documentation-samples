# Hi üëãüèæ I'm Courtney, an intellectually curious Senior Technical Writer

## About me

I want to bring my love for writing, knowledge-sharing, and technology to a mission-driven impactful company.

## Writing samples

### Sealing Technologies

I created cybersecurity documentation for a product known as the Deployable Defensive System (DDS). Geared towards military personnel, the manuals assisted with configuring computing clusters.

* [DDS Hardware Installation and Configuration Manual](https://github.com/coro121/documentation-samples/blob/main/hardware-installation-configuration.md)

* [DDS Operating System Administration](https://github.com/coro121/documentation-samples/blob/main/operating-systems-admin.md)

### Genesis Consulting

During an audit of the existing style guide for a SharePoint knowledge base, I added a section dedicated to accessible rich internet applications attributes (ARIA).

* [Introduction to ARIA Attributes](https://github.com/coro121/documentation-samples/blob/main/WAI-ARIA.md)

### Lucidworks

My most recent documentation efforts.

* [Enable Tika Asynchronous Parsing](https://doc.lucidworks.com/how-to/1wdwkx/enable-tika-asynchronous-parsing)
* [Fields Editor UI](https://doc.lucidworks.com/fusion/5.5/nmi4j0/fields-editor-ui)
