# Hi üëãüèæ I'm Courtney, an intellectually curious Senior Technical Writer

## About me

I want to bring my love for writing, knowledge-sharing, and technology to a mission-driven and impactful company.

## Writing samples

The files in this repository include the following samples:

* [DDS Hardware Installation and Configuration Manual](https://github.com/coro121/documentation-samples/blob/main/hardware-installation-configuration.md)

  * This manual was crafted to help military personnel install and configure a computing cluster during combat. All graphics were created by me, using photo editing software and Dell server stencils.

* [DDS Operating System Administration](https://github.com/coro121/documentation-samples/blob/main/operating-systems-admin.md)

  * Upon successful completion of installing the DDS hardware and accompanying configuration, the next steps included configuring the RHEL operating environment from the Linux command line.

* [Introduction to ARIA Attributes](https://github.com/coro121/documentation-samples/blob/main/WAI-ARIA.md)

  * Introduction to ARIA Attributes is a document I created while working at the United States Department of Agriculture. I managed a SharePoint knowledge base that occasionally required light HTML.

* [Documentation Workflow](https://github.com/coro121/documentation-samples/blob/main/documentation-workflow.md)

  * After assuming the role of documentation manager, I created a workflow to show the as-is scenario for documentation requests.
